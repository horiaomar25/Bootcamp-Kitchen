## Overview
Welcome to Bootcamp Kitchen, your all-in-one solution for finding 15 minutes recipes to make during lunch break. 
Bootcamp Kitchen provides us with quick 15 minute recipies that bootcampers could use to make nutritious meals whilst learning. The application provides a variety of meals such as gluten-free recipies. 

## The Brief

My team were given a brief to solve a problem that bootcampers face when learning on a intense 16 week course. A common theme amongst the group was at the time to make nuturious meal. We decidied to make a application that would provide 15 minutes recipies to give bootcampers more time and also make sure that they were have a nutritious meal. 

 ## Problem Statement:

"The intense nature of this course has had a negative impact on the average bootcampers eating habits."

What could help us solve this problem? Bootcamp Kitchen

## Research:
In order to create an app that truly meets the needs of users we conducted a thorough research of our competitors, created a questionnaire and obtained valuable information. The most valuable and comprehensive data was collected during our numerous user interviews with our fellow bootcampers. Through these interviews, we learned that our fellow bootcamper eating habits had changed since starting the bootcamp. And so, that was it - bootcampers wanted quick recipies to use to have nuturious meals.
